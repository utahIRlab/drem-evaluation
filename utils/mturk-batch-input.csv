12) love itjust wish it was a bit long a stylus is one of those item that has to feel right in your hand before you can determine if it is right for you or not this particular design to me was perfect and it had the right amount of weight that i want in a like a good professional pen my only issue was that it was a tiny bit short and thus sometimes a bit difficult to use initially after a few days it feel normal and i continue to use it dailyi use this on my samsung galaxy s iphone and ipad mini without any issue green is total cool for me excellent
13) easy to use stylish but lack functional boostcase is a great look product with a simplistic design too simplistic basically you get a plastic case for your iphone that then on to the boost case you press a button and your phone is charge when you need the extra juice so why then did i give it great design and looks stores more then ample power to get your phone from to about con the switch on the back is nonfunctional at best and will get pressed in your bag pocket etcthe idea is use their iphone case included and slide it on to the boost case when you need extra juice press a button on back of the boost case and phone is up and charge the way they would intend this to work is that you keep the phone with the slim case in your pocket and the boostcase close by in a bag etcso you can use it when you need power work it there is one problem i personally want to keep the boostcase on the phone similar to a mophie and slide the entire thing in my pocket the boostcase has a tactile button on the rear of it that must be pressed to activate the extra power and charge your phonegreat problem is when you leave the boostcase on and throw your phone in a pocket bag etcthe tactile button get pressed easily and your phone constant charged while this is functional you will soon realize that the boost case is out of power and that you no long have any boost capacity left fail they should have included a standard hard slide power switch so you could turn the boost case on and off as require learn from like the case i like the look i dont like the tactile button design and for that alone i cannot recommend this product there is a picture on the product page that show the tactile button in the backi am sure upon look at it you will agree with my me this is still a star product because it is very stylish and functional it just needs some improvement to get to a star
14) excellent solution my review heading say it all this product is excellent price well and extremely another battery pack built well feel great and include a wrist strap and usb to microusb cable for offif i could change one thing it would be the length of the usb cordthe one provided is about is a bit plug in the usb cable to a computer or other usb charger i use my iphone charger and charged this battery pack for a full overnight before i try to use it once charged use your standard cable to your smartphone or tablet and charge away simply plug in your phone to the usb port hit the power switch and are charge the device has usb port on itone is a amp port for most phone and one is a amp port for feature press the power button twice and the device activate a small bright led flash i test this with phone to begin withmy power hungry iphone and my even more hungry samsung galaxy s it work great on both device i did also test with a ipad mini but my test was for a short time and thus i will not comment on it for my phone which see moderate daily use i achieve expect samsung device was down to about battery one afternoon after heavy usage and i want to make sure it had about at the bare minimum i plug it into this charger use the amp port and i was charge at the rate of approximate every minutes per hour theoretically you could plug the smartphone into the amp port and speed up charge but it is risky in that you would provide too much power to your phone and thus could hurt the battery personally i am satisfy with the charge rate on the amp port the iphone had similar result if not a tad fast in could be related to use the iphone seem to sip at battery power when charge where as the samsung use full power even while chargingone thing to watch out for when you put the battery pack in a bag make sure it is free of obstacle so that the power button do not get depressed while moving around this happen to me once but minor adjust in my storage of the device in my bag resolve the issuethi is a star item and respectful so love it and have no hesitation in recommend it
15) so simple yet so necessary love itthi is something we have need for a long time we have iphone s in our household and i insist that they all be protect with screen cover i was the install in the family and so i generally did a good i never did a great job as something was always off i usually could not align the protector to the home button or the speaker and camera i never heard the end of it this device is quite simplistic the plastic molding clip to your iphone on both then take a screen protector and continue to install it make sure you the screen to avoid bubble the molding acts as a guide so you install the protector at the right spotthe first time quick recommendation before you attach the molding use a piece or two of scotch tape and lift off any debris from the iphone screen just stick it on and off across the whole screen then use the included microfiber cloth to the screen further to remove oil and smudge then attach the molding and use the microfiber cloth once again to make sure you have not miss a i recommend you hold your iphone at a few angle to make sure there are no tiny dust pieces or fiber hanging around on the screen finally install your new protector and smooth it be bubble free and perfectly love this product and idea its a for mebut i do wish that price was a tad bit better
16) great idea but improvement is require do it work yesi it practical yes depend on your use casei dont think this will really fit your wallet if you are try to keep your wallet on the thin if you use a leather wallet like i do the sound is completely muffle and hard to hear that being said it will work great for item that you can attach it to such as backpack luggage do it work simply put this is a bluetooth device that you pair to your smartphone and then utilize an application that is available for it to make it use basically you must pair the trackr to your phone and use their application to find your lost article or its last known test a simplistic use case in and around my home i simply pair the device to my iphone s and downloade the trackr application once the application was launch on the phone the it show the trackr connected and i was able to send an alarm to it as well as use the built in gps functional of the app to find where the trackr was i then decided it was time to do a range test and left the trackr on our dine table while walking out to the expect the connection bluetooth connection between the trackr and the application was lost i then proceed to click on the locate trackr link in the application after which i was given a map with the last known location of the trackr now it was time for reverse put you can press the button on the trackr itself and it will sound an alarm on your iphone basically press and hold down the button on the trackr while you are walking around your home and if the trackr application is running on your iphone it will make a sound even when in silent is my one major negative the application basically has to be left running in the background on your phone in order for this device to stay connected via bluetooth if you quit the application then it will lose the connection to your phone and only have record the last location when it was while this will work if you are track an item that you had at one point and left somewhere ie key backpack luggage etcit is quite scary i mean if the app was running when i was in my office with the trackr attach to my backpack and then i proceed to quit the application and head to the library where i left my backpack the app would tell me that the backpack was still in my office last known location scary the wallet idea is the alarm functional would be somewhat inefficient in this scenario since the sound will be muffle when this is tuck inside of a wallet pocket it is also thick the gps functional may help you find your wallet location and that could be somewhat of a just hope you dont have to find out the hard knowing where it iswa then not knowing at allnow where it is useful is in certain around the home key yep we all misplace them and go nuts look for will help you know if one the key are actually in your home and two use the alarm when you get close to the trackr find them i can think of a few ways to use this at remote maybe too big to tape on back of one and other item you spend time look for i also think this would be a great addition to any luggage you have when you travel especially checked it to your suitcase launch the application and leave it running when you arrive at your destination and are wait for your luggage you can just bring the application to the foreground and wait for a connectiona sure sign your bag is around and will eventually make it around the belt so you can retrieve iti think it is a well price gadget that solve a problem that most of us have at one point or the otheri just think it needs a little more work in functional explanation of use etc","Wilson Electronics SignalBoost DT 463105 Desktop Cell Phone Signal Booster for Small Home or Office, 3G Only, Up To 1,500 Sq Ft",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BQIC%2BUjeL._SY300_QL70_.jpg,"['STOP DROPPED CALLS: Boost 3G cell phone signals in your home and office.

2) best bluetooth speakerphone i have use i have been use this hand free bluetooth for a few week now have a newborn in the car i will not hold the cell phone up to my ear i will only use bluetooth have always been impress with jabra product i have one of their in ear bluetooth and it is the best one i have for block out noise and for voice clarity however when i received this i was certain it would not compare to supertooth light bluetooth speakerphone blackthat i have had for a few years i was convinced no other speakerphone was better for the car after all it sound great never received complaint and took it in the house to charge when that said i was interested to try this device thinking it would not compare to what i already had boy i was wrong first of all when you turn on the jabra the power button is on the side right away a lady voice states to turn your cell phone into discovery mode it states to enter the universal pin of but that was not need on my phone within seconds my cell phone was pair right away the device automatic download the phone book from your cell phone once this is done and you power it off then on the unit make a chime and states you are connected so you know you have a connection i believe you can turn off the blue light on the jabra to show it is connected however i like have it on it is not a distract while driving and is a solid light when you receive a call the voice states the number that is calling it is not hard to miss to accept the call simply hit the phone icon in the center speak as desire and you have the option to turn the volume up or down on the top left and right very simple but yet very nicely design i love how loud the call get and the clarity of the call and the voice built into the phone when your call is over simply hit the phone icon again when you power off the unit it states it is power off it is great since you probably will be in the car while use this and if you forget if you did an action on the phone you have the automate voice to let you know you to my blueant which i thought was the best one out there this one blow it out of the water the benefit over my blueant are as follow to turn the blueant on you would have to slide the microphone out and you would have to remember to slid it back in to power it off with the jabra if you forget to power it off it go into a standby mode the blueant has the annoy flash blue light to let you know you are connected when the blue light on the jabra is solid and not interference for me the blueant do not have the automate voice command letting you know you are connected if it is power on and off etc i find this so helpful with the jabra even though i know i have hit a button to hear a woman record voice telling me what action is taking place is wise it is perfect i debate whether or not i would like that the clip was built into the unit since my blueant has a magnet you place on the visor i find the jabra to be easy since it is all built in and prevent the device from get lost to the main unit unlike my bluetoothi cannot speak for the low battery indicator since it has not run low and i also bring it in the house to charge it through my usb port on my computer every night and like habit take it out to my car along with my cell phone now i will say my blueant do not have a low battery indicator so i have no idea when it is running in all the one i love blueant and thought i could not find a better speakerphone for my car this one has proven to be the best i have learned my blueant is really outdated or jabra is very advanced regardless jabra is my favorite and i did not think that was possible call wise i have had no complaint i use it a lot on the interstate with a newborn in the backseat and nobody has said they cannot hear me or any interference from the traffic it do have a small delay sometimes and get silent but that is worth it for the clarity this speakerphone the past i would not have bought a jabra speakerphone since i was so hooked on the blueant but after a bluetooth headset and now this top of the line speakerphone i think they are the brand i will be pick out in the future i like it so much i bought my elderly mother one since she transport my daughter and i did not want her fumble for the phone anymore especially with my daughter in the car i am very impress enough i got it for my mother and will recommend it to other
3) another belkin product that works well the good things i case snap easily on the iphone and provide a snug fit with a nice surface around the edge to grip the phone wellit come in a variety of colorsthe edge of the case provide a slight elevation for the phone when it is laid on its front or back offering more protectionthe opening for the camera on the back and the recharge cord on the bottom are perfect and do not interfere with phone usethe hard clear plastic on the back side protect the phone wellmy one less than perfect hard clear plastic on the back seem to scratch easilyall in all i found the case an excellent one that protect my phone and the investment very well i have not try the headphone opening so i would caution buyer to read several more review to see if the case interfere with the use of headphone if that is of concern with that one precaution i would highly recommend the case
4) never knew how much i need it i have use a battery bank before but in today day and age it is so easy to plug device into our car and wall that we never really think we need them however i never knew how much this one was need until i had itwhen look around i was thinking of get one that was mah for about the same price however this one has mah and the dual portsit is a bit hefty weight but that is obvious because it is a power bank when i received it it was almost charged up but i plug it in to make sure the whole bank was charged there are blue circle on the outer front to let you know how much charge it has i had three when i went to charge it and then four solid circle once charged i was very impress with the quality of the device it is made very well i also like that you can use it as a flashlight push the power button twice and voila you have a flashlightthe other time i use my power bank another brand and did not hold much of a charge was when i lost power in my home a few years ago in the dead of winter it came in so handy i never knew how handy this device would come in or the timing of after charge it up and packing it all up in the nice little mesh blue bag that was included i found when this item became priceless i am one of those people who likes to be prepared but nothing prepared me for the time i was go to use this one night my father call and said he need to go to the emergency room i knew he has been in poor health i call my sister who lives near me up north and we took the trip down south to pick him up and get him to the er he has never been to an er he was a pilot so flying rely on his health being pass by a doctor so he was always fearful of them long story short this was not just a cut finger but they told us that night he was not go to live long running out of the house my sister and i both were use our cell phone to call family from the er my sister was get low and she joke that it would have been nice to remember to bring an extra charger but in the er room there was nowhere to plug it in anyway we were sitting there watch our father in so much pain but knew we need our phone i then remember i had that blue bag tuck away in my purse we were both able to charge up our phone since we both use the same adapter we were not able to use the dual part but both of our phone were juice my father was taken to a room upstairs to rest he had ask for his cell phone and kindle he lives with his kindle he said he did not know where the charger were for them though we both told him not to worry we would look for them we went to his house to retrieve the device and could not locate the charger still have everything in my bag meaning the power adapter as well i went back to his room that night and charged up the battery bank then with the adapter that were included i was able to charge both his phone and kindle at the same time by the time he woke up they were fully charged he was so happy since he knew he was go to be there for have to say the battery option came in so handy when we sat at his bedside with his lights off not able to see things i would use the flashlight on the bank it is not too bright but give off just enough light for you to see what you are doingi now keep this bank fully charged up and in my purse i literally did not know how handy it would come in and how much time and stress it would save us my sister has since bought one herself even with it being heavy i still take it with me in my purse because you just never know when you are go to need iti also would like to add i was provided this device in exchange for a review at the time i was offer another battery bank but ask if i could review this one instead and the company was very accommodating i look back and am so glad i was able to choose this one it literally was a lifesaver for us
5) fit my needs the case snap on quite easily yet has a tight fit and is very attractive there is no problem reach the control or charge the phone with the case on the back is sturdy and appear to be more durable than other case i have try the first thing i really like about it was how the case feel when i hold the phone it is smooth but not slippery i notice on the package that it has a soft touch double coat antislip finish and that describe it perfectlythe instruction were easy to follow to add information that make one find if an honest person find the phone and wants to return it there is space for much more information to be share but i just want the basic information to guide someone back to me in case i lose my phone i can see that a business person or someone who wants to be more would find the case even more use for share much more information than i do still it is an inexpensive kind of insurance for me if the phone is lost and someone do want to return it to mefor my use i can find nothing wrong with the case or missing that i would add as with most things one must decide if it fit your needs the best

3) id happily pay double for triple for this perfect iphone case this case is amazing it is the perfect case it has soft inside silicone wrap to cushion your phone and a hard outside shell that keeps the case solidi originally bought the verizon silicone case that was available for the iphone on launch day and it was a total joke you look at it sideways and it falls off or get stuck on something i almost drop the phone a dozen times just because of the case slip off or get stuck in my pocket it offer no protection at alli decided to try this incipio case and it is amazing i love how it has a very simple solid block look with a matte finish i was pleasant surprise at how easy it was to put on and take off and how perfectly the two pieces fit together it is not too thick like otterboxe but offer great protection the case has a lip that stand above the screen enough to protect it from flat drops but not too much to make it very thick it just feel solid and fit easily in my pocket now im not one to drop my electronics very often but i actually drop this once and the case took it like a champ this case just feel like such solid protection that i dont even worry about it at all the buttons are in all the right place and are easy to use i especially like how the bottom near the speaker and the port are three separate hole instead of one which give you a very secure tight feel to the bottom in fact the entire case just feel tight and looks greatin conclusion i will never buy another brand case again i paid for this case at the time but id happily pay double or triple that price now that i have use it highly recommend
4) a lifesaver for those of us with chronic dead electronics we have two young daughter they have completely taken over all of the portable electronics in our house if you are like us you probably always have something that is low on battery at all times a typical scenario in our house is someone pile the kid in the car to go to the store or the mall or out to eat or wherever and grab the ipod only to find them dead these are the only things that keep us sane so that is where a portable charge solution would be greati was provided a yubi power ypa mah power bank for test and review and was ask only to give my honest review so this is what i impression the product looks great i received a silver model and it has a very nice outer metal body with plastic end it looks and feel very solid in your hand it has one power button one led that lights in three colors a micro usb input for charge the power bank and a normal usb output for charge your electronics it is about the length of two c battery but not quite as thick and not very heavy at all it is very compact and sleek look it also came with a small inch micro to normal usb cable for charge the unit which is nice so you dont have another long cable lay around i doesnt have any kind of capacity gauge so you just have to have it charged up when you need itit came with some charge to it so i plug it into my computer and charged it until it was full the indicator light was red while it was charge and turn green when it was full it only took a few hour to top it off for the initial charge after it was full i did some testingtest i took my old rd gen ipod touch that had about battery left and start charge it the battery in the this old ipod model is small than current model so it should charge a little fast it is an old battery and isnt as strong as it use to be but it still last a while i checked it every minutes or so and got the following readingsstart point chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes i mention before the old battery in this ipod isnt that great so the may not be perfect but the important thing is it quick gave the small battery on my old ipod a use charge the following test with an iphone have much more consistent i plug in the power bank into my computer to charge it again and it was fully charged in the morning and ready to go took the fully charged power bank and plug in my mostly deplete iphone that had only charge remain i got the following readingsstart point chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes full chargeoverall great result it was average about per minute which seem pretty good for a amp charger the power bank had plenty of juice to fully charge a pretty low iphone without any we took the discharge rd gen ipod touch and threw it in my wife purse with the power bank and checked it when we got to our destination where we would need an ipod to keep our daughter occupy it had increase the battery level to around in about minutes which gave us enough power to survive the trip it charged the ipod touch quick and the power bank gave off very little heat if any in the purse i can see this scenario happening several times a at work we are not allow to plug in any electronics into the usb port of our work computer that leaves me with the only option of climb under the desk with a charger block to charge my phone at work not really the best option while im at work my phone sit on my desk receiving email and text and i occasional use it for web browse app or remote access use there is no wifi available and the lte really eats up the battery fast i decided to plug in my phone to the power block while it was sitting on my desk and it successful kept my phone fully charged all day it was great i had a full battery at the end of the day it is a great option for charge your phone when you dont have a power plug overall the yubi power ypa mah power bank work great during my initial test and usage the product is compact and easy to use it looks and feel like a high quality piece of equipment the current price of is competitive with the other power bank of this size that are available on amazon but the yubi power product looks like it is built a lot better than its competition i can see this as an excellent option for a long plane trip or other travel where you do not have access to a power plug my biggest problem is go to be try to get this thing back from my wife i will probably have to get a second one highly recommend

3) id happily pay double for triple for this perfect iphone case this case is amazing it is the perfect case it has soft inside silicone wrap to cushion your phone and a hard outside shell that keeps the case solidi originally bought the verizon silicone case that was available for the iphone on launch day and it was a total joke you look at it sideways and it falls off or get stuck on something i almost drop the phone a dozen times just because of the case slip off or get stuck in my pocket it offer no protection at alli decided to try this incipio case and it is amazing i love how it has a very simple solid block look with a matte finish i was pleasant surprise at how easy it was to put on and take off and how perfectly the two pieces fit together it is not too thick like otterboxe but offer great protection the case has a lip that stand above the screen enough to protect it from flat drops but not too much to make it very thick it just feel solid and fit easily in my pocket now im not one to drop my electronics very often but i actually drop this once and the case took it like a champ this case just feel like such solid protection that i dont even worry about it at all the buttons are in all the right place and are easy to use i especially like how the bottom near the speaker and the port are three separate hole instead of one which give you a very secure tight feel to the bottom in fact the entire case just feel tight and looks greatin conclusion i will never buy another brand case again i paid for this case at the time but id happily pay double or triple that price now that i have use it highly recommend
4) a lifesaver for those of us with chronic dead electronics we have two young daughter they have completely taken over all of the portable electronics in our house if you are like us you probably always have something that is low on battery at all times a typical scenario in our house is someone pile the kid in the car to go to the store or the mall or out to eat or wherever and grab the ipod only to find them dead these are the only things that keep us sane so that is where a portable charge solution would be greati was provided a yubi power ypa mah power bank for test and review and was ask only to give my honest review so this is what i impression the product looks great i received a silver model and it has a very nice outer metal body with plastic end it looks and feel very solid in your hand it has one power button one led that lights in three colors a micro usb input for charge the power bank and a normal usb output for charge your electronics it is about the length of two c battery but not quite as thick and not very heavy at all it is very compact and sleek look it also came with a small inch micro to normal usb cable for charge the unit which is nice so you dont have another long cable lay around i doesnt have any kind of capacity gauge so you just have to have it charged up when you need itit came with some charge to it so i plug it into my computer and charged it until it was full the indicator light was red while it was charge and turn green when it was full it only took a few hour to top it off for the initial charge after it was full i did some testingtest i took my old rd gen ipod touch that had about battery left and start charge it the battery in the this old ipod model is small than current model so it should charge a little fast it is an old battery and isnt as strong as it use to be but it still last a while i checked it every minutes or so and got the following readingsstart point chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes i mention before the old battery in this ipod isnt that great so the may not be perfect but the important thing is it quick gave the small battery on my old ipod a use charge the following test with an iphone have much more consistent i plug in the power bank into my computer to charge it again and it was fully charged in the morning and ready to go took the fully charged power bank and plug in my mostly deplete iphone that had only charge remain i got the following readingsstart point chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes full chargeoverall great result it was average about per minute which seem pretty good for a amp charger the power bank had plenty of juice to fully charge a pretty low iphone without any we took the discharge rd gen ipod touch and threw it in my wife purse with the power bank and checked it when we got to our destination where we would need an ipod to keep our daughter occupy it had increase the battery level to around in about minutes which gave us enough power to survive the trip it charged the ipod touch quick and the power bank gave off very little heat if any in the purse i can see this scenario happening several times a at work we are not allow to plug in any electronics into the usb port of our work computer that leaves me with the only option of climb under the desk with a charger block to charge my phone at work not really the best option while im at work my phone sit on my desk receiving email and text and i occasional use it for web browse app or remote access use there is no wifi available and the lte really eats up the battery fast i decided to plug in my phone to the power block while it was sitting on my desk and it successful kept my phone fully charged all day it was great i had a full battery at the end of the day it is a great option for charge your phone when you dont have a power plug overall the yubi power ypa mah power bank work great during my initial test and usage the product is compact and easy to use it looks and feel like a high quality piece of equipment the current price of is competitive with the other power bank of this size that are available on amazon but the yubi power product looks like it is built a lot better than its competition i can see this as an excellent option for a long plane trip or other travel where you do not have access to a power plug my biggest problem is go to be try to get this thing back from my wife i will probably have to get a second one highly recommend

27) beautiful leather nicely made case as soon as i put my hand on this case i could feel that it was really nice leather not the fake kind that some lower price case claim are leather it is a deep black and smell like leatherit is sleek and professional look with even white stitch accent and three card slot on the inside there is also an additional inside pocket for a small note or emergency cashthe magnetic closure is nice and keeps the cover closed my samsung s snap quick into the interior builtin case and come out with a little push from behind the screen is completely expose and all port speaker mic charge camera headset are clearly been use a much big case before use this and can see benefit and some usage drawback to a flip case so it is really all about how you use your phonea flip case is thin and neat it not only protect the back of your phone but the glass front as well it is professional look and comfortable in my hand there is nothing to hinder access to the charge port that some bulky case can a flip case means that if you want your phone open you will always have a cover to either flip over or lay flat taking a photo means holding the cover out to the side if you want to put it in a car mount you have to flip the cover over and even then it can be difficult to hold it in place if you like to sit in a meeting and see all notification as they come in youll have to keep your cover open it will not fit into a belt clip eitherso if you like the idea of a flip case this is a really nice one great for a man or woman looks professional in any business situation and will drop into a pocket briefcase or purse without the threat of crack or scratch the i just took one star off the rating because after use this for awhile i notice a smell coming from the pocket area im not sure what it is but it smell like overheate electronics i thought it was my phone but it isnt im hope it fade with usei was provided a sample to test for review

25) small and great for quick chargeup for the price this is a great emergency power bank it is not meant to be one that will completely charge a dead phone or charge it numerous times it is only mah which will take my samsung s from a low battery to fully charged very quicklyit do get a little warm but not necessarily too hot that i am concerned use itit is small and rubbery with a key chain end in case you need to keep it handy at all times the only problem with that is that the power cable is not built in so you would need to keep that somewhere handy too it do come with a usb to open end cable with plug for micro usb mini usb apple pin old style and nokia which provide a way to charge it through any usb wall charger or your computer as if you flip it it will charge your device if they use one of those plug or you can use your own usb cable a power bank this size will not charge a table all the way through either and may have trouble with device that require more output i cant charge my samsung galaxy tablet but most power bank cant touch that but i can charge my kindle and the price this is a great one to keep in a glovebox or was provided a unit for test and review

27) beautiful leather nicely made case as soon as i put my hand on this case i could feel that it was really nice leather not the fake kind that some lower price case claim are leather it is a deep black and smell like leatherit is sleek and professional look with even white stitch accent and three card slot on the inside there is also an additional inside pocket for a small note or emergency cashthe magnetic closure is nice and keeps the cover closed my samsung s snap quick into the interior builtin case and come out with a little push from behind the screen is completely expose and all port speaker mic charge camera headset are clearly been use a much big case before use this and can see benefit and some usage drawback to a flip case so it is really all about how you use your phonea flip case is thin and neat it not only protect the back of your phone but the glass front as well it is professional look and comfortable in my hand there is nothing to hinder access to the charge port that some bulky case can a flip case means that if you want your phone open you will always have a cover to either flip over or lay flat taking a photo means holding the cover out to the side if you want to put it in a car mount you have to flip the cover over and even then it can be difficult to hold it in place if you like to sit in a meeting and see all notification as they come in youll have to keep your cover open it will not fit into a belt clip eitherso if you like the idea of a flip case this is a really nice one great for a man or woman looks professional in any business situation and will drop into a pocket briefcase or purse without the threat of crack or scratch the i just took one star off the rating because after use this for awhile i notice a smell coming from the pocket area im not sure what it is but it smell like overheate electronics i thought it was my phone but it isnt im hope it fade with usei was provided a sample to test for review

31) large clear took a little figure out this is not your average cube speaker it is large about inch square if you think that is small get a ruler and draw a inch square and figure on it being that tall as wellhowever what you give up in a small footprint you gain in sound and volume it has great sound deep clear crisp vocal great for music podcast stream radio or whatever it has a large face with onscreen touch control volume forward backward mode selection and pause it also display what the input is blue line or radio and it announce in a unique voice when it go into or out of bluetooth modei havent try it as a phone speaker but i tend not to want to use a bluetooth speaker for phone use too many people in the house listen thenit take a little finagl to figure out how to use it but really it become pretty self explanatory after some use it come with a usb to micro usb cable for charge and it also has a usb port on top which allow you to power or charge a phone or other device while it is running it come with an audio cable for device that dont have bluetooth you can also use a micro sd card in a port on top to play music from if you dont have it on a phone or other deviceit say it is natural wood design but im just not sure what they are refer to there is no obvious wood in the exterior of this speakerso there is some great sound great volume and many option for usei was provided a unit for evaluate and review
32) best car mount style ever ive try many other car phone mount this style is my favorite for many reason but the biggest reason is that you dont have to battle to get your phone release quick most phone mount have a spring loaded set of grip that hold the side of the phone this do as well but it release with a quick squeeze of the two side buttons which open up the two side grip they remain open until you put your phone back in and push the button seen inside the red circle which trigger it to clamp the two side phone mount has a sticky suction bottom and an additional clip to create a more secure suction on a window or dash even if it is a little bumpy the mount is completely adjust front and back side to side and the bottom of the phone rest can be lower or raise the mount has soft pad area clearly visible in red to keep your phone from get scratch the only issue is that the side grip are a little shallow my droid incredible g with a gel case fit well but the side clip are just at the edge of the phone and dont actually surround it if you have a fairly thick phone it may not work as welli highly recommend this phone mount and style it is well made easy to use

35) works well leaves fingerprint im a little torn about this keyboard and case the case fit nicely minimal protection and the keyboard add a small amount of bulk to the back and is magnetize to stay put the keyboard looks nice and hook up via bluetooth easily but for me i found that use this keyboard was more of pain than just use the on screen keyboard and it has a shiny metal surface so fingerprint show up if you are use to a slide out keyboard on your phone or a blackberry this could be a great product for you since it do just what it is supposed toi was provided a sample to test and review

40) nice speaker with fm radio as well this was easy to charge and quick to pair being water resistant give it an advantage over many other speaker im just not sure how many times i want a bluetooth speaker in my shower to listen to music but catching up on the news via the radio is a great option i certainly dont want to answer a call in the shower as a bluetooth if you want something near a tub hot tub pool or even out in the rain this could be the sound is pretty good not as great as other speaker in this price range but maybe you give up a little bit of sound for the water proof feature it has on board control for power forward back pause and call answer the outside is a silicone rubber with port seal off i havent try it submerse in water but it do repel small has a suction cup on the back for mount on a smooth surface the fm radio was surprising loud and for many station clear it didnt pick up on my favorite and it is difficult to know which station it is actually on since there is no display but once you find yours just keep it therei was provided a sample for test and review

2) you cant ask for much more from a bluetooth headset i use this with a samsung rugged phone for when driving and i have few to no complaintsi do use the ear loop as i have never been able to find an inear piece that fit my ear canal but that is no problem i had hope that this would work as an inear unit since it was so light i thought i wouldnt have any problem but no luck for methe thing that always concern me is sound quality when it come to bluetooth headset i realize that some of the sound quality issue has to do with the phone but most has to deal with the headset i have had an excellent experience with this headset as far as what i hear on my end it is great the volume can be raise to a loud enough level that i can hear well when i am in a loud vehicle cab i really do notice the noise cancellation technology making a difference compare to other headset i have use i hear people very clearly in often noisy environmentsthe only drawback is that sometimes people say i am hard to hear or that i sound distant i have try repositione things to make it better but it appear to be hit or miss sometimes people can hear me clearly other times is sound very distant my only course the unit is easy to use flip open to turn on flip close to turn off the talk button is a little flimsy to use and hard to press down but the headset do allow for voice activate for answer call so that is what i use most of the timebattery life is extremely good i can almost go a week with use the unit while driving and not need to rechargei can speak much to the roam distance since i am often not much farther than feet from my phoneso all in all i do recommend this unit i would give stars but the audio quality problem on the other end of the line cost one you have any question i would be happy to answer since i use the unit daily just leave a comment and i will try to get back to you",Motorola ELITE FLIP Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Silver,,"['Simply pair the device by tapping the charging case to a phone with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.

2) good in a way but bad in a way ok if you really want a mirror screen on your ipod this is it it really do look like a mirror while the screen on the device is off now turn the screen back on and the mirror is gone you can now enjoy all your cool app well maybe not so much since the screen do give you that mirror like effect it doesnt completely go away when the screen is on it give it this weird type of effect similar to watch a d screen without the glasses it do not distort the image however its just a weird type of effect also it make the colors a little off to be honest i could not stand look at the screen for more than five minutes lucky i install the mirror screen on my son ipod and he love it he doesnt seem to have a problem with it like i did so i guess this just means im get cannot give it a total bad rating since it do turn your screen into a mirror screen just like promise but i also cannot give it a perfect score because it took away from the ipod experience in my opinion by remove some of the color of the beautiful screeni hope this review help
3) perfect almost i love it when product do just what theyre supposed to do this screen protector do exactly that it protect your screen from scratch and it do reduce smudge the only problem that i have with this screen protector is that it make the screen look a little dull its not so bad as for me wanting to take it off but it do remove some of the clarity and bright of the deviceoverall this is a good product i think its a bit pricey at a piece but it do what its supposed to do
4) definitely recommend it after test this new jabra supreme bluetooth headset i can say that this a solid bluetooth headset easy to use not too bulky good look and what more important it has great audio quality battery is great as well ive been use it for two days straight without have to recharge itit only take a couple of minutes to sync this headset to your phone and youre set to go easy and simple just for test purpose i try the nano bluetooth adapter on my laptop and it works great its extra slim too so it will not add a mayor bulk to the side of your laptop if that is what you intent to use it for i also had my son try it on the playstation he said it was as easy to connect as any other bluetooth device and that the audio quality was great as welloverall i am very pleased with this headset jabra has a winner here i definitely recommend it
5) the best case ive ever own this case is the best case ive ever own after purchase this case i bought one more for a coworker as a christmas gift and one for my wife its just an awesome durable case that really protect your phone my coworker drop her phone a few days ago and she thank me for give her the case both the case and the phone were damage freei had a problem with a mac case which made button press super hard this case actually make the volume buttons and the onoff button much easy than use the phone alone its just perfect trust me you buy this case youll probably end up recommend iti highly recommend this one more thing the case is a little hard to install and uninstall but not impossible but then again once its one why would you want to take it off and risk damage to your phone
6) not up to jabra standard ive had my fair share of jabra product and i have always been happy with the quality and performance until i got my hand on the stone this is seriously not up to the jabra standard that ive grown accustomed tothe most important aspect of any bluetooth headset device is sound quality sadly the stone do not meet my expectations sound quality is mediocre at best battery life is even sad i mean this is the first time that my bluetooth device battery die before my phone is very awesome i give you that it fit comfortable around the ear i hope that jabra can match the style with quality on their next project
7) good but restricted to work great let me start of by saying that the product is of great quality and it will probably work with most people and car however i found a mayor flaw in the rotate system that will only allow you to bring the phone down to a certain degree you can move sideways as much as need you can also move up as much as it is need to be adjust but you cannot move it down too far because the design block you this means that you will not be able to adjust it in any part of your car if the dashboard is too high or if you happen to be on the short side since you will not have the phone facing directly at is great and the suction cup is super strong and secure while still being able to easily remove and install again i really want to love this product unfortunately it was a no for me as i felt very limited to adjust it the way i want it which was on the high side of my toyota sienna dashboard i end up remove it and install it on my desk as a phone holder it works great there for menote to the designer of this mount next time make the rotate head free to move all the way down in order to accommodate all car and preference",Belkin Anti-Smudge Screen Protector for Apple iPod Touch 4th Generation (2 Pack),https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Zb4a%2BG7rL._SY300_QL70_.jpg,"['Resists fingerprints and other smudges', 'Protects from scratches and scuffs', 'Tru Clear for optimal screen visibility', 'Fast and easy to install', 'Includes 2 screen overlays, cleaning wipe and smoothing card']"

2) wellconstructe charger but not much power original reviewwhat can i say about this one it do the job deliver a steady and consistent amount of power to recharge my motorola razr phone and appear to be and more durable than the nonoem charger for sale here on amazon and elsewhere ive gone through a couple of offbrand charger that seem to break after a year of use that cost a few buck more than this one if you are look for a good charger for your phone or anything else that charge via a microusb like my kindle fire i would recommend this one updatethe above review was written after use the charger for about two week after a long period of time while my comment on the durable construction of the charger remain valid the power output is pretty minimal and i am change my rating from a star to a star charge my motorola phone take a heck of a long time if the power level is less than and for example when it to and plug in during a twohour drive it consistent never get above charged
3) easy to install and good job the review of this thing are all over the place in my case it was very easy to apply this to my droid it looks good fit snug and do the job compare to the one it replace ths one make my phone look brand new again
4) easy to install and do the job overall this cover do what it is supposed to do it protect your ipod screen and reduce the glare in my case it help stop a lot of the smudgy fingerprint this one was not too hard to line up and put on you install it on your ipod let me point out a couple of things clean your ipod screen with the soft cloth that come with the screen protector do not use water to assist you but use a gentle wipe motion with the cloth why you dont want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprint and have your fingerprint memorial on your ipod make sure you use the that come with it or a credit card to help smooth out the bubble be patient line it up and go slow this cover doesnt have much to be slightly off if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side you will start covering the ipod edge case vs the screen if that happen slow back it up and start againoverall this is not too bad and do what it is supposed to do and i think you would rather have a screen protector vs a scratch up ipod
5) durable charger this is my second powergen dual port car charger to own unfortunately i lost my first one in a rental car and it do the job well deliver a steady and consistent amount of power to recharge my phone and my kindle fire at the same time and appear to be and more durable than most of the nonoem charger for sale here on amazon and elsewhere if you are look for a good dual charger for your device that charge via a microusb i would recommend this one",Belkin Anti-Smudge Screen Protector for Apple iPod Touch 4th Generation (2 Pack),https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Zb4a%2BG7rL._SY300_QL70_.jpg,"['Resists fingerprints and other smudges', 'Protects from scratches and scuffs', 'Tru Clear for optimal screen visibility', 'Fast and easy to install', 'Includes 2 screen overlays, cleaning wipe and smoothing card']"

2) a great skin cover for the evo d i was a little nervous because this skin is about double the price for other skin for the evo don top of that the post office deliver it to the wrong address i was all set to buy another one and one of the much less expensive to boot that not to say that is expensive by any recently replace my blackberry curve for the evo and one of the things that i like about my old phone was that the skin and phone pouch kept that phone look good for yearsi bought case holster cover side pouch with belt clip for sprint htc evo d here on amazon and it fit perfectly with just a slight bit of room to give when i put the phone in the case i got a nice snug fitthi case itself is form fitting took it out the wrapper and it immediately snap over the phone slot are perfectly align although the usb connect will have to wiggle it a thick plastic not blown away by the gloss but there are few alternative for men great looks fine and snug fit in phone pouch what more could you ask oh and only stars
3) better design than my previous case when i bought the evod two years ago i immediately bought an extend battery because i had heard the nightmare story about android phone and battery lifethe battery start to depreciate in strength about month after use and has been clinging on to life since then the case however has serve me well until my business trip abroad a week ago the phone fell from my hand and the case cracked along the topi replace it with this battery and case and im here to tell you that i should have bought a spare battery for my spare battery a time agothi new mah battery is noticeable better than the original spare which took about a week for it to break in bearing in mind that with these lithium ion battery you have to fully charge them let them run down to nothing and repeat the process for several days this practice stretch the battery capacity to hold a charge for hoursthe other notable thing about this set is that the cover is actually design to be slim with the slight hump over the extend battery itself the phone actually feel for less than you cant be it
4) a if youre an active jabra sport a critical review jabra sport use with htc evo sports track intro and inspection test and battery strength optional sports track conclusion i love jabrathe been produce about a dozen or so different style of bluetoothenable headset and headpiece a year the company has also manage to get the full support of the wireless community where almost all of the wellknown device are connect with it and now there are software company produce innovate work seamless with your mobile phone the recommend optional sports track is one that i didnt realize that i need or would feel crazy is in my opinion the wireless accessory company out now bar nonethe set headpiece two overtheear headpiece attach by a rubber band i dont know if the rubber band contain a bluetooth connect or is just a material that connect the left and right earpiece while there be two bluetooth receiver for each ear in any case the band doesnt seem to serve any purpose if the band is indeed to wrap around the head for support the one size fit all doesnt i first walk a mile trek the headset would come loose and id find myself readjust as i walk and talk on the phone despite the reception and the battery strength i was all set the give the sport a star rating until i took it out for a spin on a few other occasion and never had that happen againthe second night i went out i subconscious firm adjust both pieces over my ear and it mold to the shape i never move from then on still the rubber band barely noticeable didnt seem to play any practical purpose if there was one in third night went just as wellafter about hour of use without charge it the battery finally went out a full charge came about hour after being plug inthe set also come with micro usb ac adapter and a of paperwork which to be honest is there for legal reason and nothing else once you turn on the headset power button the set will whisper in your ear power on making your phone discover in the wireless network section cause the headpiece to say connected all of the volume and fm radio buttons are selfevident one of the truly great features of this product is the fact that no one who was talk with me for any length of time knew i was talk to them on a bluetooth headset until a gust of wind came by even then they thought that i was holding the phone next to my face the clarity is above reception the audio fidelity was exceptional although the quality of audio depend on the file that youre use and not the device itself from music video to mp to my treasure collection it is better than the fidelity of bluetooth headset with the exception of the bose series but the bose has some drawback as i mention amongst the paperwork that included is an invitation to download the wireless app call endomondo sports track i first look at the advertisement and quick dismiss it as i have about app on my phone already and most i havent look at since i downloade it originally another app didnt seem appealing especially since my business was to test out the quality of the week into the play around with the sport i just happen to come across the package for the headset when i notice the advertisement again i went to the marketplace and pull up the app i quick notice that people who had downloade the app was use it for a host of different things much more than just running mile in an hourthe app is important because it can serve as a visual gps if youre walking running hike swimming or anything where you want to see where you start out and where youre at the stat heart pace calorie etc notwithstanding it is the ability of the program to inform you of where your location is how long it took to get there and the distance that really really impress me on the endomondo site you also have a feed where you can see other people from around the world use the app in real time to mark their bluetooth the application itself is notorious for drain battery power from the headset and the phone id recommend for this device since youre go to be use it primarily outdoors and perhaps for hour at a time this would be handy to keep energi to go mini micro usb tip everything from the price tag to comfort to fidelity to working with rd party app for your android or iphone the jabra sport is definitely a musthave
5) the days of wire connective are number motorola wireless sports headphone sf a critical review and add the onepiece bluetooth receiver to that list the benefit of a wireless stereo bluetooth headset device like this wireless stereo sport headset are rapid add all of the convenience of wire earphone such as highfidel speaker with in a compact design the ability to plug into portable mp mp and smartphone relatively inexpensive various price with the function of the onepiece bluetooth headset the ability to receive and respond to incoming call wireless radiofrequence connective long battery lifethe drawback has always been you need both kind if you want to listen to music in stereo hassle of wire the expense of buy two sports headphone is one of the better wireless headset i own its market as have hd speaker system its difficult to prove that its actually high definition but the dynamic range is incredible listen to stream audio up to kbp and mp at was a power of this device is its driver and its built in amplifier so if the music source is of lower quality there no way that the device will produce a hd sound it can receive and replicate what is transmit the good news is bluetooth pair device like a laptop or a smartphone usually has a builtin android phone like the evo d i own there are several very good free equalize that you can download from the marketplace when engaged the beauty of the headset is you are waterthe royal band uk in the one if you were here tonight jazzy on watch the documentary the was almost like being in a theater battery life the battery life was consistent between hour these past couple of week this was one of the things i most concerned with comfort they fit snug that the way i like it i have a bose wireless and im always concerned when walking outside with them because there nothing to keep them attach to the ear and unlike the jabra sport i didnt have to get use to them compare motorola to jabra sport the jabra sport is the other stereo bluetooth headset that i have and it too is market for active design jabra slim design slightly lighter but was a bit too long took a few days to get accustomed to the feel yellow w black trim sports theme large wraparound ear make for a snug comfortable fit black w chrome trim conservative design make it suitable for many large buttons easy to navigate easily accessible while buttons spread across both rl speaker the onoff button very small and difficult to find sound call good easily as good as moderate price earphone call reception very sound is between moderate and highend headphone the combination of the builtin amplifier along with the source equalize setting make sound reproduction life hour to fully hour for for amazon fluctuate conclusion as i mention these kind of headset will within years start to fully replace the wire headset that have become the of people with portable music player and smartphone gone will be the days when a snag wire means that youre shell out for good quality wire earphone these wireless stereo bluetooth do it all and considering the price of around youre actually buy an upper midrange headset for the price but without the worry of a wire connectionif youre in the market for a singleear bluetooth receiver id say consider buy one of these stereo bluetooth receiver for the price of a decent singleear you have all of the features except a hour battery life as oppose to about hour with a singleear piece but these can also double as a theater headphone that you can use as far away as think about this when youre watch a long movie like the lord of the ring real question is is the more robust speaker system of the motorola of such importance that youd be willing to pay the price difference instead of buy the jabra sport which is nothing to sneeze at last thing i am not an exercise junkie in fact with the exception of basic yoga and my strenuous exercise is far in my past my knee wont hold up under any kind of gym workout but these are market to the fitness junkie so my advice aside you might want to consider the objective advice of the fitness writer who have some thought to add about how it works in a if you plan you use these in a my purpose motorola wireless bluetooth headset sf stars
6) an allinone solution motorola roadster a critical review the roadster is motorola piece bluetooth car speaker and navigation system the system also has the ability to act as a receiver for stream audio and as a voiceactivate personal assistant via the android app my motospeak and motorola car a measurement of x x the device is noticeable broad and that not a negative criticism in anyway but just an beautiful metallic silver front has a touchpad on the bottom that allow you to control the musicaudio function the top keypad row control the phone function the right side is where the micro usb charge port and power switch is located my trip to the grocery store a mile away provided me with perfect opportunity to see how the device works outi engaged the motorola car finder app and it immediately ask me to take a snapshot this i discover was more for my benefit as a snapshot would help me to remember where i was park from a view but i decline and went on to the next screen just as i arrive at the mall i received a phone call the speaker on this device is before the conversation end i inquire about how well i sound i was impress that her answer was fine considering it was somewhat windy as i was coming into the parking lota few moments later i turn on the my motospeak and had the system text within seconds a voice blare out which number afterwards the system repeated the message i spoke to impressive after a couple of week of play around with all of the features there are some minor things that id like to see in a future version i wouldnt mind seeing a glass display instead of the metal mesh that cover the speaker so that display can give you a visual of where youre at or who calling any speaker can be move to the side and to the bottom id like there to be included a micro usb to ac adapter the device come with almost no charge and it took a couple of hour of it being plug in before the battery indicator light turn is important because the kit only come with a car charger if youre park in an area and will be there for a considerable amount of time i wouldnt leave this device lie around and especially not plug in this means on the other side that youll need to have an ac adaptor handy so the device can stay charged while indoors im not crazy about the price tag if it had a glass display and extra cords maybe but by itself i think a fair price would be in the there you have it motorola roadster stars
7) a good budget headset but with questionable bonus features motorola hk a critical review motorola bluetooth headset hk is a nice nofrill singleear bluetooth around depend on the fluctuate sale price this is a good buy if you want a headset that has a good call upto feeti have very small ear and i found the ear hook fit snug and yet very comfortable it connected to my evo d immediately and the voice attendant verify connective as well as battery this come with setup instruction i couldnt find any mention of the app you could use with your android phone but the android app motospeak seem to work much better with this device than my prefer app talk for upto clear call clear music to ft roam range front cover answer call from a football field connected to your phone up to feet away allow you to roam freely without your phone throughout your office home or yard obstruction may limit range of use back believe iti test out this device for days and youll get a reception under the best conditions of not even and most certainly not feeti call motorola illinois hq this morning in order to get perhaps some wade through the command for i was finally able to get a live person but my frustration didnt end thereafter our introduction the next minutes were spent listen to him read what was print on the box and deduce that maybe i had an old phone and perhaps there was just too much interference where im htc evo d is barely month as far as the interference issue is concerned i dont know of anyone whod be talk from an unobstructed view from an unattended phone at feet away believe me i wouldnt walk feet away from a phone that i paid plus tax because i felt that this phone was too heavy to carry if i did id have a different problem when i got all things being equal ignorant customer service aside if you measure the price against the basic function features it is a good hk stars
8) the best bluetooth this season motorola sflex hd a critical review about a month ago jaybird release what i thought to be the best new sports bluetooth headset this season jaybird freedom spirit jabra sport at this point was perhaps on the cutting edge with their wireless headset couple with endomondo sports track app a better than average microphone and a reasonable price was difficult to sf had a better speaker system and a more secure fit than the jabra sport but trail very slightly with battery company like sony with their xbabt offer a marginal better sound but sacrifice fit microphone and a decent battery life for a premium freedom spirit gave you two ways to fit the headphone both are extremely comfortable the microphone and speaker are above average but whose battery life and recharge time and annoy button arrangement really took away from a headset that had solve many of the issue of previous season model the two area where jaybird is deficient and designi not an issue with this new motorola sit seem as if motorola heard the legitimate criticism about the headphone release across the board last year and made some very noticeable improvement over their sf the earphone are just as snug but the earpiece is a little more flexible i especially like how they wrap around the head when you first take them out you notice a bit of a weight to them but youll soon forget that when you put them onthe battery life is a shade under hour hour of any of the following talk listen to music watch a movie on a bluetoothenable device and the headphone will chime and tell you how much battery life is that the sony dont dothe microphone issue is clear there is no sports bluetooth headset with as loud of a microphone system as these s period they blare when a call come in i was told during a mile walk back home that i was walking next to a noisy crowd and yet the nearest people a couple and their child were putt grocery in their trunk were about feet away when i got home i gave the lady my phone and headset and i grab my business phone and had her to call me on it as we walk outside of the house in different directions i had to hold the phone away from my it wasnt on speakerphone its battery recharge in less than minutes after being completely music and music sitting on my microsd card in my android phone sound crisp very little distortion compare the new motorola to amazon bestsell wireless sports headset sound fidelity call reception motorola s nov freedom sprint nov sport good comfort motorola s very cost jabra motorola sf jaybird motorola sony battery life jaybird sf s hour conclusion now has never been a better time to buy a wireless bluetooth headset the sound reproduction has improve dramatic over the past years and the cost has drop significant for the cost of replace a couple of good wire headset you could have a decent wireless bluetooth headsetat this point the best overall is the motorola s follow by the jaybird the jabra although about a year old is still a very good buy i love the snug feeling and the great speaker system in the sf but for a few dollar more id recommend the s over them i wouldnt recommend the sony under any the battery life and recharge cycle and the button design on the jaybird were different it would be very difficult to recommend the jaybird over the s or vice s stars
9) a very good accessory to keep in the car great accessory to have in your have another usb car charger and this works the same wayyou have a dual port for charge any usb device we have android phone and tablet and this is definitely something we keep in the car for your make the mistake of thinking that you have an accessory that will quick charge two almost empty device fast it will recharge an almost empty cellphone to near full capacity on a minute ride home when the phone screen is shut off and your not play any media from itif you try to plug device you see a dramatic decrease in charge capacity especially if that other device is a youre go on a long road trip take this along as well as an external battery pack
10) otterbox commuter for the galaxy s a critical review we just upgrade all of our phone and two of them are an s and the we got the commuter case we bought several accessory including the maxboost shell host combo so for us its essentially a comparison between the otterbox commuter to the maxboost commuter is a piece set that include a soft rubber case and a hard plastic cover that wrap around the back and side of the phone it also has a slim screen protector it doesnt have a belt clip though all for the maxboost is slightly slim yet it cover both the back and side very well it also has a design that feel good to the grip and a swivel holster way kickstand screen protector and kickstand a felt interior to protect the screen when the phone invert all for otterbox commuter plastic inner case hard outer case screen shell holster inner case hard outer case screen protector swivel holster way kickstand felt interior the commuter is not to be confuse with the topoftheline defend which will protect the phone from almost any kind of fall it is a good form of protection if youre relatively careful with your phonei didnt like the fact that a kickstand and belt clip was not built in and when compare to other private case maker like maxboost are making better basic hardcover case and for a lot less
11) lugulake bt bluetooth speaker a critical review the bt is one of most elegant of wireless speaker i have seen in some timethi bluetooth speaker is also doubles as external wire speaker for your old analog or mobile device with a mm review unit is a brown but is more like a pearl speaker features x and has a builtin tablet holder in the front two watt speaker on the left and right bluetooth or roughly of wireless connective micro usb and mm cable mah internal battery for a hrs of use depend on the loud and use of other the accompany video i play a few random track to give you an idea of the sound reproduction of this the whole the unit is a very good set that is not what this means is that the speaker is very versatile if you like a of music from time to time but if you listen to bassheavy music exclusively the speaker probably wont appeal to you but for me this is a positive because i know this kind of speaker typically has less noise distortion at the lower frequency and reproduce vocal more thing that should be pointed out is that this speaker by a newly form private audio company is market toward mass market once and a while ill get a question about how do this device stack up against this or thatthere are three grade of of the device on amazon are for the consumer market with an equal amount share between the division and the professional division the standard like the price are much higher as you go up the this consumer grade device is well made the sound is very good and its elegant design means that it fit nicely with your better audio equipment or cellular device and not like those gaudy look product that offer little in the way of value for the device is a winner
12) duracell powermat go power overnight external battery a critical review duracell go power overnight is mah lithium ion external battery and is a part of their powermat charge systemthe set come withthe usb to usb some peripheral device in the duracell system the go power overnight can charge a cellphone or a tablet wireless but by itself it can function separate as an external ion battery have to be is charged to full capacity drain until completely empty before recharge this should be done for several days in order for the battery to perform at its maximum battery has a light indicator and it measure x x and weigh about mah battery can recharge a tablet or a phablet once or a standard cellphone iphone or android twice before need rechargingthe cost is the biggest issue for me for about the same price you can have a mah battery from a private label and very good one to is a nicely design unit but it should have at least double the charge capacity for the price

AEL6CQNQXONBX,electronics accessory computer component,B007L5NKZO,This product was retrieved because 'AEL6CQNQXONBX' often buys products in category 'Audio & Video Accessories' and 'B007L5NKZO' is also associated with category 'Audio & Video Accessories',"1) slightly better than average but not great good for cell phone usage but not so good for ps the jabra easygo bluetooth headset is attractive look lightweight at ounce and fit comfortable on your ear you can wear it with or without the ear hook which is nice but my personal preference is with the ear hook so it doesnt slide out of place and end up fall and possibly like the voice guidance that tell you when the headset is connected and when the battery level has been deplete it also has the ability to connect to two bluetooth device at the same timeon the inside of the headset it lights up to tell you when its charge and when its power onit is advertise that this headset can provide up to hour of talk time and days of standby time however i have been unable to get hour of talk time and it always seem to last around hour for me if you wont talk a lot and will charge it often then this may not be an issue for you but i use it a lot and wish it had a better battery i use it not only with my cell phone but also to chat on the playstation while play games and it just doesnt last as long as other motorola headset that i own i havent really test the standby time because i typically just charge it every it seem to partially lose its connection with device and you start hearing electronic noise instead of words when it do this i disconnect the headset and reconnect and then its fine again it doesnt do it very often but it is a hassle to deal with when it i think this is a good headset for the price i would recommend it for casual cell phone use but i wouldnt suggest purchase for use on the playstation i have use many bluetooth headset over the last five years and i would consider this headset slightly above average but not great
2) good sound quality comfortable fit great battery life i have own many bluetooth headset over the years so here is my opinion of the plantronic m in comparison first of all this headset can stream music or podcast from your smart phone which none of my previous headset could do it also has builtin noise reduction to reduce or eliminate background noise like wind rain traffic or music it has voice alert that tell you the battery level volume level talk time and more it has a special battery meter that will show up on your screen if you have an iphonethi headset sync easily on my samsung gravity touch or ps if you happen to play video games online the sound quality is good for an average price headset i dont have any problem with disconnect or voice have also own other headset that tend to want to move or feel like they are go to fall off not a problem with this one its held secure in place and is fairly comfortablei love the battery life on this headset and it will last me at least hour of constant use i usually stick with a motorola headset because most of them also have good battery life i have had many headset that only last for about hour and i didnt like that at all you can get a lot of use out of this headset without constant recharge itthi headset will come with a wall charger and its cover by a year limited warranty for the price i think this is one of the better headset option at the present time
3) great battery life comfortable fit and sound good this is a good low cost headset it may not be the fanciest headset but it works very well the sound quality is good and what i have come to expect of motorola headset the battery life is fantastic and if you can deplete the battery in a single day then you are probably spend far too much time on the phone because it will last for at least hour it sync easily on my samsung gravity touch phone and on my playstation it come with a simple wall charger and will charge pretty fast if your headset battery die then a minute charge will get you a couple hour of talk time the headset fit well in my ear and doesnt move or hurt my ear like some headset do i have own five or six motorola headset and they have all work well except for one so motorola has a good track record for me
4) works well and is comfortable to use silver and chrome finish looks nice and it has a builtin ball point pen there a million different type and brand of stylus to choose from you can find anything from the cheapest little plastic stylus to a very fancy one with multiple features i dont expect a lot out of a stylus other than it needs to look nice and be comfortable to use of course it needs to work well as well this stylus meet all of my expectations it works well when you touch the screen it always register your touch of course you have to get use to push a little hard than is necessary with your finger but that is the case with any and all different stylus stylus also looks nice and with its silver color and chrome look trim its smooth exterior and well balanced body make it comfortable and enjoyable to use as an add bonus it has a builtin ball point pen it also come package in a case so its easy to give as a gift the case is somewhat cheap but for the price its not bad at all these would make a good stocking provided for review
5) small and simple but works well i like that it attach to your keychain this mah battery pack is nice and compact at only about inch long and less than an inch wide it come in a simple black case that say power bank on one side and is white with the oxa logo on the other side its a basic design but it has a keychain on the other end i really like the keychain option so its always with you when you need it i have use about different battery pack like this and that was a new and interesting option to me it come with the usual usb cord that is use for charge the battery pack and also power up whatever device you are connect the battery pack to it also come with a variety of different adapter that can be use to power up different cell phone or other device it also come with the adapter need to connect to the ipad or if you need to connect a lightning cable to it then you will just plug it into the battery pack and not use the included cable you can more or less use it with any device that charge via usb cablethi battery pack wont fully charge my ipad but it will give it a nice boost it will allow me at least or hour of use before recharge again if you travel a lot or use your device a lot then its very convenient to have a battery pack like i said before i have use many different battery pack some of them are very small and some are large some are very cheap and some are more expensive this one doesnt have some of the option that i have seen on more expensive model like a builtin flashlight or a power button but you pay for those option if you are look for a low cost battery pack that is reliable and works well but without all the bell and whistle then this battery pack might be a good choice for provided for review
6) high are crisp and clear but lacking as far as bass go important to be made for people with small ear these headphone come with a very brief instruction manual usb cord and wall charger instead of replace battery you just recharge these headphone that a big plus for me because battery arent convenient when you run out and dont have any more on hand they are also very expensive to buy all the time and wasteful you can either use the usb cord to plug it into your computer or usb hub to charge or you can utilize the included wall charger to charge it the wall charger make more sense most of the timemy last pair of headphone has me a little spoil because they are top of the line and sound amazing i am not go to say that these headphone sound just as good because they dont however there is a huge price difference between the two and i have to take that into consideration when it come to the sound quality the high sound crisp and clear and you can hear all the little detail that you might be missing with cheap headphone the low are a little lacking in my opinion they can produce some bass but its very limited these headphone also dont go as loud as my last pair and just dont have the power i will say for the price these are still very decent and a good they look great with their shiny black finish they have a volume adjust on the side along buttons to move forward or backward through music track there is also a power button that is use to turn on or off the headphone and also to sync the headphone via bluetooth to your compatible device i stream music to these headphone from my ipad and havent had any problem at all i was able to sync these to my ipad easily on my first attempt without any problem i love have fully wireless headphone because i can listen to music while do chore around the house without carry my ipad around i have a medium size house and i can go anywhere on the same floor within about feet with minimal loss of signal i have try go to the basement or upstairs but it constant loss the signal that bluetooth technology for you though that doesnt have anything to do with the quality of these headphone issue that i have with these headphone is that they are apparently made for people with really small ear i think my ear are more or less average size but inner section of the part that sound the ear is hardly big enough and it isnt the most comfortable at all they are fully adjust in size and they have a cushion that rest on the top of your head for comfort overall though i think these headphone are quite good for the cost even with a few problem
7) works great has safety shut off in case of a short and i like the bright blue face plate this wall charger white and has four usb port on the front three of the port are amp for charge lower power device like the iphone the last usb port is amp for quick charge of higher power device like the ipad combine it has amp so you can use all four port at the same time without slow down that charge time i have a couple similar wall charger that will slow down if there are multiple item plug in at the same time its made solid and seem to work very well the plug flip down or close into the body of it for travel and storage the face of it is a blue panel that will bright illuminate when in use this make it stand out from similar wall charger and i like the look of iti found out the other day that it has a builtin safety mechanism that can sense if there is some type of short or problem i has plug in one of my device to charge and the usb cable that i use to charge it had a short in it i saw a spark and smoke roll up from the cable and then the wall charger immediately shut down that port and the light on the front of the wall charger kept flash to indicate there was a problem i never thought of that before but its good to know that it will shut down if there is ever a problemoverall i think this wall charger is reasonably price and seem to be good quality i like the safety feature and the led lights that illuminate the front face plate in bright blue provided for review
8) nice look and works well but only has a single usb port and only mah capacity this battery pack is small to medium size and it its black with a mirror type of finish it really looks like a small cell phone more than it looks like a battery pack it has a power button on the side and four little led lights on the front that tell you when its charge how much it has left to charge they also illuminate when you are use it to power a device and will tell you how much charge is left on the battery pack it come with a usb cable that is use for charge it and can also be use to charge most cell phone you need to charge an ipad or iphone then you use the ipad or iphone cable to connect to the battery pack it has a builtin flashlight that can come in handy on occasion i use it sometimes in my dark truck if i need to see somethingthe only downside that i have found so far is that it only has a single usb port so you cant charge more than one device at the same time i have many other battery pack that all have at least two usb port so i found that a little disappointing the single usb port do output amp so its good for charge high power device like an ipad but it can be use for any device the battery capacity is mah which is almost enough to fully charge my ipad but not quite the new ipad have a much large battery so it wouldnt even come close to fully charge one of them i could have use a little more battery capacity in my opinion this battery pack is better suit for charge a cell phone or other small electronic device my wife daughter son and myself all have our own ipad so extra battery capacity and extra usb port are important to i like the appearance of this battery pack and it works well but its usefull is limited only have a single usb port and a small mah provided for review
9) inexpensive well made and can be use for a variety of different device smartphone gps ipad mini or other small tablet this smartphone and tablet holder come with a long bend arm suction cup smartphone holder and a tablet holder its easy to mount just clean you window push the suction cup firm into place and flip the switch on the suction cup it locks firm into place and doesnt fall off then decide which adapter to use and screw it on you can easily switch the adapter whenever you want the adapter slide large and spring shut to fit a variety of different item and hold them nice and secure they have a rubber pad on both side so the device doesnt slide around or get smartphone and tablet car mount is great for a variety of different things it can be use to hold your smartphone for hand free talk through speakerphone or through a bluetooth headset its perfect if you use your smartphone as a gps unit because the arm is so long and it bring the gps close to you if you have a new gps unit then it should fit into this holder i have two different brand one is sony and the other is magellan and they both fit nicely into this holder both of my gps unit come with a simple holder that doesnt give you many option this holder allow you to put the gps where you truly want it and bring it close to you this holder will even hold an ipad mini if you want i test my ipad mini in it and it fit just fine and it could hold the this smartphone and tablet holder is excellent because its price fair well made and can be use for so many things best of all it stays stuck to the window and doesnt fall off like provided for review
10) so very cute and it works well include usb to lightning and micro usb cable this cute little keychain is perfect for young kid and maybe some adult its basically a multifunction cable that has usb on one end and lightning and micro usb on the other end the cable is wrap up inside a cute little blue hippo that is made of silicone its really quite adorable and i think most kid would get a kick out of itthe cable itself is about inch long when not in use its held inside the hippo when you need to use it you pull it out of the hippo mouth and stretch it out dont worry the hippo is tough and you wont hurt him i have use it to charge my phone with the micro usb cable and it has work fine it also works well to charge my ipad mini but it may be difficult to use while your ipad or ipad mini is in a casethi cable is inexpensive and the hippo is so cute it works well and i think it was a brilliant idea i would recommend this for your young one i think they will enjoy itsample provided for review
11) it can charge on both port at the same time without power loss this usb car charger is black and has a square front with round edge the edge where you grab it to pull it out have these little rubber dot that help you grip it to pull it out of the cigarette adapter it fit nice and snug into the adapter and doesnt wiggle around out lose power some similar usb car charger that i have use dont fit as well as this oneit has two port on the front one charge up to amp and the other charge up to amp the total maximum output is amp so you can use both port at the same time at full power and without sacrifice speed some adapter have a total maximum amp that is insufficient to charge on both port at the same time at full power that not a problem with this oneother than that its pretty simple there is nothing especially fancy about it but its inexpensive its simple and works provided for review",Motorola HK250 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HSvwSpAJL._SX300_QL70_.jpg,"['Noise reduction technology allows for noise, wind and echo cancellation, so your voice is clear.', 'Stay connected to your phone up to 300 feet away.

3) good earpiece but you can get better for slightly more just to provide a point of reference im benchmark my comment again my current ear piece motorola use in the galaxy s skyrocket running android iphone s running ios s running ios ear piece comfortable but if you break the fully adjust ear hook and need to use the rigid one its less average ear piece use motorola flip mic to turn the device onoff absolutely my favorite feature motorola has a slide button which make it easy to tell when the device is off but not as convenient as the flip ear piece tell you when you are tell you when you are ear piece roughly about feet the earpiece will tell you when you are out of range and pick the call back up as soon as you get back into the range about feet however if you exceed the range the unit will tell you that you are loose connective and when you walk back it will tell you that you are regain the setup went smooth on the android device however i had to try pair the earpiece with the two iphone a couple of times before it connected once the connection was made i never had a ear piece great sound and noise cancel the sound quality is noticeable less crisp than my current earpiece in some case it sound like you are talk to someone at a distance outdoors no issue in moderate to heavy v time is great time was not i wish the hx boom to turn onoff the earpiece this is absolutely my favorite feature in my current earpiece you never have to guess if the earpiece is off or motospeak you to dial via talk to the earpiece and respond to text message great feature that is a must it would be a better investment to spend the additional money to get one of the following item from motorola htxt hx or elite flip the difference in price is anywhere from to but you will get a much nice earpiece all three of the aforementione item have motospeak and the flip mic feature",Motorola HK250 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HSvwSpAJL._SX300_QL70_.jpg,"['Noise reduction technology allows for noise, wind and echo cancellation, so your voice is clear.', 'Stay connected to your phone up to 300 feet away.

2) loving itupdate after some more use update there is a little lag but nothing like what i had on my old blue tooth when i am listen to the navigation command on my phone and so little that i hadnt notice it when i first try it out audio is good it connect and disconnect very quick the buttons are easy to use nobody has complain about hearing an echo the microphone is pretty strong though and outside noise is readily apparent to the person on the other end also because of the outside noise it is sometimes impossible for me to use the voice command on my phone the headset is comfortable but just do not feel secure and i always feel like i have to adjust it to hear better it has not come off or fallen off bit it just feel like it might i would like to have had the chance to have a small ear bud piece that could be use with the earloop i think that would have made all the difference if i could i might drop it to stars but no way can i justify stars so i left my star rating as is i am still happy to have it and enjoy use it but the honeymoon overi just got the jabra extreme and i love it let me tell you pair it was no problem change the attachment to better fit on my ear was easy it came charged and ready to use instruction booklet is short and sweet and easy to use it is not the most comfortable headset however that is really the only negative and that is why i did not give it starsbut this is easily stars i love all that come with this usb charger car charger and wall charger some are not happy with the short cord of the ac charger however i like it as it keeps it close by and less likely to be step on or otherwise damage the sound quality is excellent and there is no lag i have a dare and with my old plantronic there was a lag that would make me miss the first word the phone would say this was extremely bad when use the function no such problem with the jabra also i should note that nobody has complain of an echo while i use this again this was a problem with my plantronic i do wish there were different size ear bud that came with the unit that work with the overtheear attachment there are two different size attachment for over the ear as well as two different size bud that fit into the ear i dont feel they would hold as well so far i am very happy with this
3) you get what you pay for i have use several different blue tooth headset and for me the gold standard is my motorola oasis try out the samsung was disappointing and i have samsung flat usually a big fan our cell phone are also sammy they are the reality phone there are a couple of plus you get a nice little assortment of extra in the box the voice is very pleasant the nicest i have ever heard by far so far everything was go well and show a lot of i made a phone call the the other person sound so far away i thought that my earpiece was not in well i kept fiddling with it but nothing help nothing like the oasis worse than that i could not make a call use the voice command it would constant hear a message command when i clearly was saying call that was enough to give it a bad score what the point of hand free when you have to pick up your phone scroll through the contact find the one your are look for call that person then put the phone back down by the time i am done i could get two ticket and an accident the only reason i did not give it one star is the voice it really sound nice not computerize and not cold it did not hang in my ear and kept moving i had to readjust it often the other plus is this is the only headset other than the oasis that did not have a terrible lag when use my phone navigation that kind of important when you are not sure which way to turn etcso this is certainly a cheap note i did not say inexpensive headset there may be some value here but i just dont see it this may work different on other phone but i thought since it was a sammy it would be great with my phone it obviously wasnt i say pass on this one there is way better out there
4) i almost love it my gold standard for blue tooth headset is the motorola oasis i love it i have to say the hk is pretty darn good first let me say that it is a good if not great value it is relatively comfortable not as comfortable as the oasis especially for the design i still have to readjust this but not as often as some other brand namely samsung i think if it came with different size cover for the ear bud it would be better the ear bud is kind of large battery life is excellent and while i use it a lot i dont have to recharge it for easily days distance is about feet from my phone and then it disconnect the only thing that really keeps this from a star rating is have to readjust it a minor annoyance and its maximum volume a major annoyance it is actually hard for me to hear people if they are not speak loud if i could i would give this stars but it really is better than stars so the hk get the nod to stars i also like that it tell me the battery status when i turn it on pair is easy as it should be and the charger works perfectly on my samsung the control take a little get use to but they work well and are fairly intuitive you really dont need to read the instruction volume control calling pick up etc is on and off take some get use not much but for me its not where i would have expect itit is on the bottom and i am not use to it there i like the big power button i just had to get use to it and i did for the price i dont think you can find a better bluetooth headset than the even if you spend a bit more this is number to the oasis come on motorola give us a better fit into the ear and let us make it a bit loud and its a home run even at a higher price
5) a bit shiny but nice especially for the winter this is certainly a winter look cover for the iphone and fit the iphone well the finish is a little shiny and in the photo it looks a little but in person it looks much nice and for those who are really fashion this is a great winter case the only real problem i have with these belkin case is they dont give you much screen protection but the rest is protect well and the case is pretty light i like the hardness of it and while it is shiny it do not collect fingerprint easily it clean up well and it doesnt collect lint like the rubberize one
6) smooth with a funky design somehow the belkin shield spot case remind me of water the bubble design is fun and a little mellow the colors are nice and blend well together it fit the iphone perfectly but the only problem i have is that i wish the lip was a little big to give my screen a little more protection the polycarbonate finish feel nice and is not slippery but also do not give you any extra grip the nice part about it is that it do not attract and hold lint like some rubberize case it always looks clean and if it do get dirty like if your kid start play with it after they just ate some chocolate it easily wipe clean it also do not pick up fingerprint unless your kid just finished eat chocolate the glossy surface made me think it would gather fingerprint like crazy so i was very happy to find that it didnt the fit is tight and not that easy to remove which is nice i did have to press kind of hard to get it in and that always make me nervous i will update if the design wear off easily but for now it seem quite durable
7) if i had small finger i might be in love omg the mac is pretty amazing it is almost perfect and i would have given it stars except for a few things that i will mention later first it really hold my iphone perfectly i mean it is in therei was a little nervous get it in but now i know it is not go anywhere you do have to be a little forceful but youll get iti do wonder how much extra stress the pressure put on the screen however and i wonder if you drop it will that extra pressure but worse and make it more likely to crack the glass i just dont know and i dont plan on drop it with that said this is a nice case that doesnt bulk up your phone as much as other case out there i love the belt clip i dont want to keep it in my pocket it will break for sure it is very handy to have on my belt and it slide in and out easily enough without still worry that it can fall out on its own the stand for me is useless but it is still a nice feature i just dont have a need for it lately i have been seeing so many things that seem over price and low quality not so with the mac talk about value i think you get a lot for your money the only other negative i can say is that i have a very hard time with the volume control i think if i had small finger it might be easy but even them im not sure for me this is not normally a big deal as i dont usually play around with the volume but it is worth note i would give this stars there is enough around the screen to keep it relatively safe a nice case with nice features and seem to be good quality it is also very rugged look
8) not so natural view the thing i hate most about anitglare screen protector is the granular it presents this is not as bad as other i have try but it is still present and i dont think there is any way to get around it you will be give up a little bit of image quality if you dont mind that then youll love this im not so happy about it as i love the image quality i normally have and so do my wife i actually put it on hers i got lucky on this one and got one very tiny bubble on the corneri count that as a success the protector fit well cover well and protect the screen from light scratch especially from key that might be floating around in her bag if she had kept it on i dont know how long it would have last after one week it was pretty scuff but in all fair she has a lot in her said it almost feel like there is a filter over the screen i understand what she means it is subtle but you can tell a difference without it still as far as antiglare go this is probably the best i have seen so if glare is an issue for you this is the one to get if not i would pass and get a protector that is truly clear this is also relatively inexpensive compare to some other screen protector
9) one small bubble on edge very clear great protector i love it i got one small bubble that pushed to edge but will not go away normally my ocd tendency would make me nuts however my past experience with screen protector have left me somewhat cure and i am now quite happy to just have this little bubble in fact i look at it as a kind of triumph whether it is my improvement or the quality of product i cannot tell you but i would say it is a combination of both i use a special microfiber cloth that came with my care to clean the screen really well almost buff it smooth then i careful start from one corner use one hand to hold the corner in place while the other hand kind of flex the screen down i will note that with other brand i have gotten more bubble i dont know why i can get the bubble to the edge and not have it push completely out but it really is small and i dont notice it anymore the cover fit perfectly and it offer good scratch protection i can easily recommend the belkin screen protector keep in mind you get in the pack and i have not had to change the first one great value
10) update price drop great protection easy to use slightly uncomfortable clip update still go strong folks this is the best case i ever i dont even care that the price has drop to it was worth every penny then and an even better bargain now i should also note that the plastic screen protector is still greatand that with two kid who love to jump on me constant i havent found anything better for my s i think enough of this that after a year i am update it good job otterbox price update june saw it drop to and change then back upupdate just an fyi folks this is current at and free shipping this is a no brain and a steal none of the stores around me are give any kind of they have iti still love this case but i did want to let you know that if you rely on the vibration to notify you you might miss some call this do soften the vibration quite a bit if you are holding it its not a problem but sometimes when it is on my belt with a shirt tuck in and i am walking i do not feel the vibration there is no problem if i am still i also think that this is in part due to the phone the vibrate strength even on full is not as strong as my old phone so the extra cushion from the case just soften it up even morebut you know what this weekend i have seen three people with this phone and belkin case and they all had cracked get a belkin case for my s it took me only an hour to go out and buy theotterbox defend series and holster case for samsung galaxy s pack retail package black the difference is night and day and while this is more than twice the price of the belkin it is total worth it plus you dont need to spend money on a screen protector so it really isnt that much morethe defend is really a three piece full coverage case it provide full coverage for your s corner back front screen and it has flip cover for the charger connection etc and those flip flip up easily even without fingernail the case itself provide excellent grip all around without being intrusive it is a little difficult pressing the buttons on the face but my finger are a little big one of my favorite things is the screen protectorno bubble yup you heard me right no bubble that because you dont actually have to apply the protector to the screen this is awesome if you look at every screen protector i have review for my iphone and ipad they all had bubblesi have come to hate bubble and thought i would have to learn to live with them i am here to tell you i am now bubble free and so is my pressing the side buttons you do have to press a little hard but for the protection you get its fine also the opening for the camera are angle so that the thick case do not appear in the pictures the case itself is to provide good grip without feeling is no interference at all with use the ir when reading and scroll down by nod my head or turning a page with a wave of my hand share pictures and video work equally as well with no perceptible interference the only real issue is that i did notice a slight difference in wifi reception in our house with the case on it is slightly weak but nothing big and after one day i dont even think about it the entire screen and nothing is only thing that i would knock half a star for is the clip is uncomfortable and digs into my skin when its on my belt and is especially bad when my shirt is not tuck in they could have made this better and i wonder will come and downgrade this to stars later because of this for now i will say stars with an easy to instruction when install your remove the rubber gasket use your fingernail there are little space along the side you need to use these to seperate it or you risk break it once that is done the rest is easy try not to touch the inner portion of the screen as it come perfectly clean at least it did on both of ours putt everything together after this pointi easy and take less than seconds gently click everything together and you are ready to both love this case and i highly recommend it",Motorola HK250 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HSvwSpAJL._SX300_QL70_.jpg,"['Noise reduction technology allows for noise, wind and echo cancellation, so your voice is clear.', 'Stay connected to your phone up to 300 feet away.

2) small powerful this here bluetooth is among the best that ive own to use with my cellphone and ive own plenty of them see my review on plantronic motorola etcthe negative ill get out of the way first as one is total absurd to me as to why a company would do the first is the length of the charge cord from the actual ac charger that plug into the wall to the adapter which plug into the bluetooth the cord is around six inch so most likely youll need an extension cord and long power strip now if you have an outlet in an open area then this is not a problemthe last ill call a is the size of the bluetooth itself the size is so small and its powerful in pick up your voice and battery life but with that come it being difficult to touch the right buttons especially if you have large finger or are wearing it and want to turn the volume keep in mind this is a very small bluetooth headset lightweight small so that its easy loose if youre not careful and if you have puffy cheek the bluetooth will not hit your cheek and muffle the sound so small that many will not notice you are wearing it as it do not protrude along the side of your facethe over the ear part is a small wire and that great if you wear glasses as it do not bother the stem of the glasses however the first few times you wear it over the ear itll be difficult to put on and feel strange however that feeling go away after a few times and its very easy to change the wire for leftright ear it come fit for the right ear and i like wearing them on my left earand there is a in ear piece that help the speaker stay in your ear with both wire behind the wear and the in ear piece you dont notice this you have a true fit bluetooth that do not wiggle around as you was easy the onoff button bluetooth is a simple slide updown range of the bluetooth is a good feet depend on conditions if you have wall in between or floor or are in an open area etc battery life is among the best ive quality is very clear and caller can hear me has a color system and when it turn green on the headset its fully charged red means it needs to be charged yellowish color means its in between is also an extra wire for behind the ear extra ear piece and a dc car charger have a small bag would of been nice to include but im sure everyone could find something or purchase a small bag to keep it with the small wire i cant understand why jabra would give such a small give this full stars jabra has a real nice bluetooth again if you wear glasses or sunglasses then you will be very happy with this bluetooth as the behind the ear piece is very small and do not bother the stem of your glasses
3) great headset like other jabra product here is another good bluetooth headset the setup is straight forward it come with a car charger usb charger and a electric home charger note the wire for the home charger is small so unless you have easy access to the wall socket you will probably wan to use an extension cordthi headset is like other where you can wear it behind the ear or inside the ear or both i like both as the chance of it fall off if you move around a lot while talk are headset seem to sell itself on noise cancel while it do cancel noise im not sure that it cancel noise better than any other it do cancel noise but ive yet to find one that cancel outside wind well and i mean this one as well while many are not outside in windy conditions use their cellular phone i do and people on the other end still hear it the whoosh of wind and volume do not go real high but that is not enough to take away a star as i consider real wind a harsh condition it do cancel running water like from the faucet volume will increase people talk and automobile this is a very small item you may well look for a small bag or case or such to keep it in when not in use as its easy to misplace sit on etc this is something i would like to see company include with the product
4) works with my droid im use this on my motorola droid it work right out of the box pair up with no in my ear with no problem you can wear it with just the ear bud or the behind the ear clasp however i prefer both just to have it on double and prevent an life ive gotten four days honestly i cannot say how much i talk per day perhaps an hour all together wearing it standby i have it on around six hour a day come through well and people hear me well talk in wind rain or crowd is not the best but then again ive yet to find one that do a great job at this even when warning is if you perspire a lot the headset will slip around and if you are jog it could slip off wipe around your ear help or just remove the headsetthe range do not come into play with me as i keep my phone with me and operate everything from my phonei dont have any complaint on this headset
5) large headneck people beware with all bluetooth headset you must do your homework before purchase itthi remind me of the old fashion hearing aid my grandfather hadthi headset is truly a headset with this everyone will know you are wearing a bluetooth headset it fit in your ear and there is a cord that go do a clip box if you wear or will be wearing a tight top female a with low cut this may be a problem be aware you need to clip this somewhere i had on a muscle shirt and after a hour of this against my skin it wasnt comfortable its a firm clip and ive yet to have it fall off anything but again it must clip on something up near your shoulder you can clip it on the back of your shirt however i didnt find that may want the geeky look and if so this is just for if you have a large long head or neck this cord can pull if you make sudden idea would be for azeca to make a model with a large cord so you could run it down your back and clip it on your beltthe product itself is good it pair up with my droid without a problem i hear people well they hear me i dont have a problem with as i have my phone within a few feet of the headset at all times belt pocket bag etcthe earbud is very comfortable it fit firm in your ear no irritation like some other do to the inside of your ear after wearing it for a few hoursbattery life i get around hour of straight that this is the start and ive yet to find a bluetooth headset that after a few month the time doesnt go down until it needs to be charged every night im sure this is the battery and until they find a better battery there little that can be you dont mind the cord or clipping it onto your shirt then this is great its around twenty dollar cheap than the other model of wireless bluetooth
6) a must case for sony xperia tablet if youre gonna buy the sony xperia tablet z inch then this is the case you the price and features you cannot go to startthe tablet slide into the holder via a velcro holder inside the case be sure to line up the side correct so you can charge the tablet while its in the case hole are made for each portthe case has a magnetic screen onoff feature so that each time you open the case and your tablet is turn on your screen will automatic go on close the case and the screen go off team this up with the tablet feature to auto turn the wifi offon when not in use and the battery will last many also a hand strap in the back so you can safe hold the tablet in your hand without do that balance act we all do and there a stylus of this for under twenty cannot go wrong

2) external battery pack for ipod touch i have an ipod touch th generation that i use alot as such the battery on the unit is often at the point where it will not stay on after several hour of use since i do not always have a plug and charger with me i want some way to be able to recharge the battery i decided to give this unit a try along with a few i like about this unit the unit is small than my touch but a little bit thick still it is easy to carry in a shirt or pants pocket the unit is sleek and has an led readout that you can activate to check on the level of charge left on the battery the unit has a built in micro usb connect with a short cable that will allow you to charge device that utilize a micro usb the unit has enough capacity to recharge my ipod from an empty state to fully charged times before it is exhaust the unit easily recharge from any usb port you need to supply your own usb cable that can supply amp of current i use a seperate charger to charge my unit that has a capacity of amp the ipod charger cable apple connect on one end and usb on the other easily connect to this battery pack for charge the ipod there is a nice led light built into the unit that is activate by holding down the charge status button for seconds that turn on a nice white led light that is handy for times when you need a flash light turning it off is accomplished by holding down the same battery status button for two secondsi have also use this to recharge my cell phone use a special mil spec cord that convert a usb to a small plug sprint phone for the phone the battery pack is only capable of recharge it once from an empty that you must keep in mind with this battery pack this unit will only supply a of charge current if you have a device that require a higher charge rate you will have difficulty charge that device example the ipad require a a charge rate this unit require a a charge capable usb port some usb port are not capable of that level of current if yours is not this battery pack will charge very slow it is probably worth while to pick up a or amp usb charger i have a amp charger and it works greati would highly recommend this unit as long as your use demand fit the unit capabilities
3) external battery pack for apple ipad ipod and sanyo phone i received this unit from the manufacturer to test out with my ipad my two ipod and my sanyo cell phone mil spec unit each of these device require a volt dc charge supply so this volt power pack seem like the best of the directions and specification can be a bit confuse as the instruction are a translate however i find that the translate is fairly easy to understand if you just take a little extra timeone of the things you need to consider right up front is how large a battery pack you need and what charge rate you require the size of the battery pack affect how much of a charge you can put on a device and how often before it is deplete the charge rate affect how long it take to replace the charge on your device and whether it will charge at all a perfect example is the apple ipad require a amp charge rate if you plug it into a ma charger it will essentially not charge this battery pack is large enough to repower my cell phone many times my ipod times and is large enough to put a charge back on my ipad the second thing you need to know is that whatever the charge time is use your normal charger that is how long it is go to take with an external battery pack there are no shortcut here so if it take to hour to charge your ipad from a charge to a charge state use a charger that is how long it is go to take use an external battery pack that is size large enough for the battery pack has separate charge port a ma hour port and a a hour port that works well for my cell phone which use a ma charger and also for my ipad and my ipod which both use a a chargera many folks have comment on this battery pack come with a cable that has multiple tip that can be change out to fit multiple device the battery pack itself use a micro usb port to charge it with one of the supply tip my cell phone use a small narrow barrel charger one in the parts bag and my ipod and ipad use the standard apple connect also supply in the parts bag the unit also come with a a charger but i prefer use the a charger that the company sell separate it has a a and a ma charge port just like on this battery the battery recharge much fast use the a chargerone thing to note when you go to charger the battery the charge indicator lights will come on and will remain on during the charge cycle the number of lights that are on indicate the level of charge keep charge the battery for at least an hour after the th light come on since it come on when the battery is between and of all of my device work well you need to remember though that this battery will not fully charge an ipad from less than of charge it will replace of the battery capability the battery in the ipad is much large than the capacity of this charge battery from whatever point you connect it so if you are at it will recharge it to if you are at it will recharge it to one other option that you have is to just plug in this battery pack while you are use your ipad and use the capacity of it before you use up the capacity of your note you must press the battery status button once you connect the battery pack to your device to start the charge have use this battery extensive on all of the above device and it works exactly as it should it has never heated up on me and that is a real plus this battery pack definitely extend the useful time of your device and is great to have when there is no option for use regular ac power to recharge your devicei would highly recommend this unit the reason that the device earn four stars instead of stars is because of the number of loose parts for the cable and it do not have a storage bag to put them into
